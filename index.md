# Introduction
OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is a powerful tool designed to allow everyone who uses the internet to help improve it. With BLT, users can submit any type of issue they encounter, whether it's a simple design flaw like a button being the wrong color, or a serious security vulnerability. By following responsible disclosure ethics, BLT helps to ensure that reported issues are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.

One unique feature of BLT is that it rewards users for reporting bugs. As users report more issues, they earn more points, which can be verified for extra points. Additionally, companies and organizations can get involved with BLT and launch their own bughunt programs with prize pools. This not only incentivizes users to report bugs but also encourages companies to actively seek out and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

Overall, OWASP BLT is an important tool for improving internet security and promoting responsible disclosure practices. By allowing anyone to report issues, rewarding users for their contributions, and providing a platform for companies to launch bughunt programs, BLT empowers individuals and organizations to work together towards a safer and more secure online environment.

# How it Works
OWASP BLT is a bug logging tool that allows users to report issues and get points, and companies are held accountable. Testers can win money through company-sponsored Bug Hunts, tips, or the Grand Prize/Jackpot. Organizations can keep their customers happy by giving them a consistent bug-free user experience.

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator. See the Road Map and Getting Involved tab for more
details.

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of OWASP BLT is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a
security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can
help are as follows:

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the OWASP BLT project into that language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.
