# Main

OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) allows anyone to submit an issue from any website. For example if you saw a broken button on Amazon.com you can report the issue through BLT and then get a point! The more bugs you find the more points you get. Bugs can be verified for extra points and companies can get involved and help out.

# Description
OWASP BLT is meant for everyone that uses the internet to help fix it. Any type of issue can be submitted from a button being the wrong color to a serious security vulnerability. BLT follows responsible disclosure ethics.

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator. See the Road Map and Getting Involved tab for more
details.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

## Roadmap
  - The Current Roadmap is now here - https://github.com/OWASP/BLT/projects/6

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of OWASP BLT is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a
security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can
help are as follows:

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the OWASP BLT project into that language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

### Feedback

Please join us on slack in the OWASP #project-blt channel for feedback
